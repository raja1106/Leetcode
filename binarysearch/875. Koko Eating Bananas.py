"""
Determines the minimum eating speed required to eat all banana piles within the given hours.

        left region denotes --> by these speed values in left region, you can't eat all items within h hours
        right region denotes --> by these  speed values in right region, you can eat all items within h hours.. since question is min_val
        from the right region, we are returning "R", and that is "start"

        lllllllllLRrrrrrrrrr
        
        'R' --> this 'R' we are trying to find. 'R' which is "starting of the right region". As any Binary Search Problem,
        here we are moving "start" pointer to "right region" and moving "end" pointer to "left region".
        After every iteration in while loop, we are reducing search region by n/2. so T(n) is log(n)
